  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    Hello, I’m <strong>Tonmoy Sutradhar</strong> — a student driven by curiosity,
    discipline, and a passion for both science and sports. I explore the universe
    through <strong>astronomy and astrophysics</strong> while grounding myself in
    teamwork and focus through <strong>cricket</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am deeply fascinated by the mysteries of the cosmos — from galaxies and
    black holes to the fundamental laws that govern space and time. Astronomy and
    astrophysics allow me to think beyond limits, ask deeper questions, and
    understand reality at its most fundamental level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cricket plays an equally important role in my life. It has shaped my mindset
    by teaching patience, consistency, leadership, and resilience — qualities
    that I apply both in academics and personal projects.
  </p>

  <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am motivated by the desire to learn continuously, improve every day, and
    build a meaningful skill set that combines logical thinking, creativity, and
    discipline.

    refining my understanding, improving my structure, and strengthening my
    attention to detail.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Curiosity fuels discovery, and discipline turns it into achievement.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Future Vision</h2>
